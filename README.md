# Polyglot Data Science with IPython & friends

Author: [Fernando PÃ©rez](http://fperez.org).

A demonstration of how to use Python, Julia, Fortran and R cooperatively to analyze data, in the same process.  

This is supported by the IPython kernel and a few extensions that take advantage of IPython's magic system to provide low-level integration between Python and other languages.

See the [companion notebook](polyglot-ds-prep.ipynb) for data preparation and setup.

Used for a lecture at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu). The [lecture video](https://youtu.be/ZwNCUetnccw) has a live demo of this material.
